# Forex News Summarization

The NewsRagnarok API includes a powerful forex news summarization feature that leverages Azure OpenAI to generate comprehensive market analysis from multiple news sources.

## üîç How It Works

The summarization process follows these steps:

1. **Search**: Find relevant forex news articles using semantic search in Qdrant
2. **Preparation**: Extract and format the key information from each article
3. **Summarization**: Send articles to Azure OpenAI with specific instructions for analysis
4. **Parsing**: Process the AI-generated analysis into a structured format
5. **Caching**: Store the result for future identical queries (30-minute TTL)

## üìä Summary Structure

Each summary contains:

### Executive Summary

A concise overview of current market conditions with sentiment indicators highlighted. Example:

```
The forex market is experiencing heightened volatility as the US Dollar (USD) oscillates between multi-week lows 
and sharp recoveries, driven by anticipation of key US macroeconomic data and global bond market movements.
```

### Currency Pair Rankings

Detailed analysis of major currency pairs, each with:
- Rank (scale of 1-10)
- Fundamental outlook percentage
- Sentiment outlook percentage
- Detailed rationale based on news

Example:
```
EUR/USD (Rank: 8/10)
   * Fundamental Outlook: 75%
   * Sentiment Outlook: 70%
   * Rationale: EUR/USD has broken above 1.1700, supported by resilient Eurozone PMI readings...
```

### Risk Assessment

Analysis of market risks:
- Primary Risk: The most significant factor that could impact the market
- Correlation Risk: Related risk factors affecting multiple currencies
- Volatility Potential: Assessment of potential price swings

### Trade Management Guidelines

Practical trading recommendations based on the current market conditions.
